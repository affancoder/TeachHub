## How This Project Is Built

- **Framework & Stack**
  - Built with **Next.js** (React framework) for SSR and fast routing.
  - Uses **TypeScript** for type safety and better code maintainability.
  - Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first, and responsive design.
  - Organized with a clear folder structure: `components/`, `pages/`, `public/`, `styles/`, and `types/`.

- **Branding & Theming**
  - Custom logo (`public/logo.png`) used in Navbar, Footer, and as favicon.
  - App name and branding updated everywhere to "TeachHub".
  - Modern, clean UI with glassmorphism and smooth transitions.

- **Core Features**
  - **Dashboard**: Overview and navigation to main features.
  - **Teacher Management**: List, view, and (soon) edit teacher profiles with avatars.
  - **Salary Sheets**: View salary details for each teacher in a responsive table.
  - **Sidebar & Navbar**: Persistent navigation with smooth, stylish hover effects and mobile support.
  - **Scroll-to-Top Button**: Animated, glassy button for UX.

- **UI/UX Enhancements**
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
  - Smooth, slow hover and transition effects.
  - Font customization and modern iconography.
  - Accessible with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

- **Project Metadata**
  - `README.md` and `package.json` updated for TeachHub branding.
  - All static assets (logo, favicon) in the `public/` directory.

- **Extensibility**
  - Modular components for easy feature addition (e.g., editable teacher modal, attendance, notifications).
  - Ready for backend/API integration for real data and authentication.
